My exact goals will be:
DONE - Load directory list from folder and filter folders
DONE - Augment filename strings through five modifying stages (add string, counter from X to Y, Substring, and replacing)
DONE - Provide preview of new filenames
DONE - Write changes
DONE - Do it all in a three pane jframe window
DONE - Make source code available on github throughout development.

My extra goals will be:
Command Line Interface version
More modifiers (ie right to left substring, all caps/no caps, 
Rename folders
Multi level directory renaming
Kinda Done - Make a Jar version
Compile binaries for Windows, Mac, and Linux

 

Going on my past experience for writing software I'm going to do the Scotty thing and overestimate my times slightly. If everything goes smoothly and I get the whole program finished with lots of time to spare, which is as likely as finding a Unicorn carrying a pot of gold through Atlantis, then I will be hitting my extra goals. The thing I'm expecting to take the longest is the jframe gui because that is my weakest area in java. I comment as I code and I intend to use the JavaDocs which I have not done before.

Overall time: 20-29h
Coding/Commenting: 14-20h
Debug: 1-2h
Documentation: 2-3h
Testing: 3-4h

 

This is actually a program I have been meaning to write for a while so I am excited to do it. I will continue the development after this class is over because I will be using it a lot.
